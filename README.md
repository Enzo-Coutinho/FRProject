# FRProject - User side
 
FRProject is a repository developed as part of a final year project (TCC), integrating a machine learning algorithm into a smart lighting system. The project aims to automate the control of the lighting system based on facial recognition, providing a personalized and interactive user experience.

The application uses the Flask framework in Python to manage HTTP requests between the lighting system and the mobile app. Flask acts as an intermediary, allowing the app to control the lighting through a simple communication interface.

For facial recognition, the project leverages the OpenCV library, integrated with TensorFlow for machine learning processing. This combination allows the system to identify users accurately and adjust the lighting settings based on their individual preferences.

To test the project, simply download the .zip file from the release section and follow the instructions provided.

This project combines machine learning technology, IoT device control, facial recognition with OpenCV and TensorFlow, creating an intelligent and automated environment that adapts the lighting to the user's profile in real-time.
